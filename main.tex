\section{Figures}

Inserting figures is easy, while it can be a bit harder to place them where you would like to see them. The \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Inserting_Images}{Overleaf tutorial} provides a good starter. Usually you can just work with the code in this template. Please make sure that you have high-resolution figures (at least 300 dpi). Like the linguistic examples discussed above, you can label figures and then refer to them using \verb!\ref{the_label}! or, if you want to add the word ``Figure" (or ``Table", in the case of tables) automatically, \verb!\autoref{the_label}!.


\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/Figure2.png}
    \caption{A sample figure}
    \label{fig:my_first_figure}
\end{figure}

\noindent The \href{https://ftp.tu-chemnitz.de/pub/tex/macros/latex/contrib/float/float.pdf}{float package} can be used to customize the position of figures and tables. For example, \autoref{fig:my_first_figure} and \autoref{fig:my_second_figure} are forced to appear at a specific position in the text using the \verb![H]! command. If there is no reason to position a figure or table at a specific point in the text, you can also use a less strict configuration and let \LaTeX \  choose the position automatically. If you use \verb![H]! and start a new paragraph afterwards, please make sure to start the paragraph with the command \verb!\noindent! to avoid indentation.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/fathersandsons4.png}
    \caption{Another sample figure}
    \label{fig:my_second_figure}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Reusing figures} \label{sec:reusing}

If you reuse figures from published work, including your own, please make sure that you are allowed to do so. In most cases, you will need to obtain written permission from the copyright holder (usually the publisher) to re-use figures, unless the original paper has been published under an open license such as CC-BY. We generally recommend to double-check if re-using the figure is actually necessary. If it is, please make sure to obtain written permission for re-using the figure. When re-using figures that cannot be published under a creative commons license, please add a short statement to the license information at the bottom of the paper, e.g. ``Figure x from Author (Year: page), re-used by permission from Calisota University Press, is excluded from this license."


\section{Tables}

Adding tables is, admittedly, one of the more challenging aspects of \LaTeX \ typesetting. Luckily, there are a few resources that help you generate tables, such as \url{https://www.tablesgenerator.com/}. 

\begin{table}[H]
    \sffamily \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{ | L | L | }
    \hline
         bla & blubb  \\
         \hline
         blah & blub \\
         \hline
    \end{tabularx}
    \caption{A very simple table}
    \label{tab:my_first_table}
\end{table}

\noindent We recommend to use the \href{https://ctan.org/search?phrase=tabularx}{tabularx} package, which is a bit more complicated to use than the normal ``tabular" environment, but it gives you more flexibility in customizing the tables, and makes it easier to print it in text width. In the localstuff.tex file, we have defined the column types L (left-aligned), C (centered), and R (right-aligned) so you don't have to use the full commands that tabularx usually requires. In the simplest case, therefore, constructing a table is as easy as in the source code of \autoref{tab:my_first_table}. For more elaborate tables in which some rows and columns are merged, check the source code of \autoref{tab:my_complicated_table}.


\begin{table}[H]
    
    \begin{tabularx}{1\textwidth}{| L | L |R |}
    \hline
         \rowcolor[gray]{.9} Col1 & Col2 & Col3 \\
        \hline
        blubb &  blibb & 2 \\
        \hline
        \multicolumn{2}{|>{\hsize=\dimexpr2\hsize+2\tabcolsep+1\arrayrulewidth\raggedright\relax}X |}{ Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, } & bla\\\hline
        \rowcolor[gray]{.8} \multicolumn{3}{|>{\hsize=\dimexpr3\hsize+4\tabcolsep+2\arrayrulewidth\centering\relax}X |}{ Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, }\\
        \hline
        
bla & blabb & 22 \\
\hline
    \end{tabularx}
    \caption{A more compilcated table}
    \label{tab:my_complicated_table}
\end{table}

\normalfont

\section{Special characters}

From 2025 onwards, \textit{Constructions} uses the open font \href{https://software.sil.org/charis/}{Charis SIL} by default, which supports a broad array of Unicode characters. With the \verb!\symbol{...}! command, you can easily add more Unicode characters using a font of your choice, e.g. \verb!{\fontspec{Symbola}\symbol{"1F5A4}}! will be displayed as {\fontspec{Symbola}\symbol{"1F5A4}}. 

\section{Citations and references}

``Constructions" follows the \href{https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/unified-style-sheet}{Unified Style Sheet for Linguistics Journals}. Working with \LaTeX \  and BibTeX, you don't have to do the formatting manually, though. All references you cite should be in the bibliography.bib file in BibTeX format. We strongly recommend using a reference manager like \href{https://www.zotero.org/}{Zotero}. Zotero allows you to copy and paste entries in BibTeX format, thus making it much easier to work with \LaTeX. 

For inserting citations, use \LaTeX's citation syntax:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use \verb!\cite{...}! for inserting citations, e.g. \cite{Example1}.
    \item Use \verb!\cite{...}! for inserting citations, e.g. \cite{Example2}.
    \item Use \verb!\cite{...}! for inserting citations, e.g. \cite{Example3}.
    \item Use \verb!\cite{...}! for inserting citations, e.g. \cite{iadc}.
\end{itemize}
